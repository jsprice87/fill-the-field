# Consoloidate any outsanding scratch issues, sort, and formulate a plan

Migrate all the issues in @docs/bugs_scratch.txt and @docs/features_scratch.txt into formal bug and feature records in @docs/bugs.md and @docs/features.md.  Clean up bugs_scratch.txt and features_scratch.txt.
Then, using @docs/generate-tasks-issues.mdc, generate an updated tasks list with all remaining open tasks from the current current-tasks-list.md and the new issues.  
Start processing the list.  
Make sure to stop and push all progress for testing after every 'major' task.  Proceed through subtasks to complete an entire major task before stopping.

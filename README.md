# Soccer Stars Management Platform

A comprehensive management platform for Soccer Stars franchisees to manage leads, bookings, classes, and locations.

## Features

- **Lead Management**: Track and manage potential customers
- **Booking System**: Handle class bookings and appointments
- **Class Scheduling**: Manage class schedules and capacity
- **Location Management**: Organize multiple facility locations
- **Unified Webhook System**: Real-time notifications for leads and bookings

## Webhook System

The platform includes a unified webhook system that sends real-time notifications to external systems (like n8n workflows) when new leads are created or bookings are completed.

### Webhook Events

The system sends two types of events:

1. **newLead**: Triggered when a lead is created (no booking yet)
2. **newBooking**: Triggered when a booking is completed

### Webhook Payload Schema

Item processed:
- Feature #3: Enhanced Booking Restrictions with radio button logic

Ready for new feature ideas.


 - Make child language query request optional for Users.
 -- must implement language feature first
 -- add checkbox to /portal/settings 

 - Add more notification types
 -- Need to add notifications section of /portal/settings
 -- Add logic to be able to send time-based notifications (webhook commands)
 --- Day-Of Trial Class reminders
 
 - Add "CC Emails" field Notifications section of /portal/settings to send notifications to multiple locations

 - In Notifications section add a webhook that sends End-Of-Day Summary email including all bookings and new leads from the day. 
 -- Users should still be able to opt-in to getting notifications with every new lead and new booking, or just get a single summary at the end of the day

 - Multi user to login to specific business accounts.  (future roadmap feature)

 - Profile page should include password management.

  - Remove "Business information" section from portal/profile/ page because it is redundant with the section in portal/settings/.
  --  Before doing this, make sure anything that is using the values from /portal/profile are migrated to pull from /portal/settings.

  - make /portal/ and /admin/ sidebars collapsable.  Use slide animation to collapse and expand.

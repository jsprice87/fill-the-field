  > Next, we need to work on the Admin section.  There is still nothing populating on any of the pages in 
  /admin. Also, fill-the-field.fun/admin is 'Not Found'  That url should reroute to the /admin/dashboard. 
  Ask me any questions you need me to answer to help build out the admin section so we don't have to fix a 
  bunch of initial mistakes.

⏺ I'll help you build out the Admin section properly. Let me first research the current admin
  implementation and routing to understand what exists and what needs to be built.

> Research any existing code and see what has already been developed and just needs hooked up.  Also, while
   researching all of that, keep an eye out for any shadcn UI so we can migrate them to Mantine v8 while 
  working through each item.  Phase 3 looks pretty good.  ALso, add an "Invite User" feature so I can email
   an invitation to new users that want to sign up.  For Phase 4, use the context7 mcp, reasearch the 
  latest documentation on stripe and implement stripe payments system. Using what you have already planned,
   and everything we just discussed, please ask any further questions, but once we are ready, use 
  @docs/create-prd.md to generate a fully detailed PRD for the entire admin section so we have a single 
  place of truth to return to for future context.

  Research Summary & Clarifying Questions for Admin Section PRD

  Current State Analysis:

  I've found that you have a partially implemented admin section with these existing components:

  ✅ What Already Exists:
  - Admin routing structure with protected routes (roleRequired="admin")
  - Basic admin sidebar navigation with 5 menu items
  - Admin Dashboard page (hardcoded with 0 values)
  - User Management page with franchisee listing, filtering, and export
  - Global Settings page with Mapbox token, webhook, and support info management
  - Admin authentication/authorization system
  - Database queries for franchisees data

  ❌ What's Broken/Missing:
  - /admin redirect to /admin/dashboard
  - No actual data populating the dashboard metrics
  - Empty Transaction page
  - Incomplete Settings page
  - Mix of shadcn/ui components (need Mantine migration)
  - No "Invite User" functionality
  - No Stripe payments integration
  - Missing admin analytics/reporting
  - No user editing/management functionality

  🔧 Shadcn Components Found: GlobalSettings.tsx uses several shadcn components (Label, Input, Textarea,
  Badge)

  Now I need to ask clarifying questions to create a comprehensive PRD:

  ---
  Clarifying Questions for Admin Section PRD

  1. Admin User Management & Roles

  - Who should have admin access? Just you, or multiple admin users?
  - What specific actions should admins be able to perform on franchisees? (Edit details, suspend accounts,
   view analytics, etc.)
  - Should there be different admin permission levels (Super Admin, Support Admin, etc.)?

  2. Dashboard Analytics

  - What specific metrics do you want to see on the admin dashboard? (Total revenue, new signups this
  month, active franchisees, etc.)
  - What time periods should be available? (Last 30 days, quarter, year, custom range?)
  - Do you need charts/graphs, or just numerical displays?

  3. Invite User Feature

  - Who can send invites? (Only admins, or franchisees too?)
  - What information should be collected during invitation signup? (Company name, contact info,
  subscription tier?)
  - Should invites have expiration dates or usage limits?

  4. Stripe Integration & Payments

  - What subscription tiers/pricing plans do you want to offer?
  - Do you need one-time payments, recurring subscriptions, or both?
  - Should franchisees be able to upgrade/downgrade plans themselves?
  - Do you need invoice management, payment history, failed payment handling?

  5. Transaction Management

  - What types of transactions should be tracked? (Subscription payments, setup fees, etc.)
  - Should admins be able to issue refunds, adjust billing, or add manual charges?
  - Do you need transaction reporting/exports?

  6. Current Admin Scope

  - Should the admin section manage all franchisees globally, or have any geographic/regional filtering?
  - Do you need system monitoring, error logs, or performance metrics?
  - Should admins be able to access franchisee portals directly (impersonation)?

  7. Phase Implementation Priority

  - Which features are most critical to launch first?
  - What's your target timeline for the complete admin system?

  Please answer these questions so I can create a detailed, actionable PRD that perfectly matches your
  admin section needs!

  Clarifying Questions for Admin Section PRD

  1. Admin User Management & Roles

  - Who should have admin access? Just you, or multiple admin users?
  Just me for now, but might add other admin users in the future.

  - What specific actions should admins be able to perform on franchisees? (Edit details, suspend accounts,
   view analytics, etc.)
  Add and delete user accounts, edit User settings, reset User passwords, view all classes, view all locations, view all leads, view all bookings

  - Should there be different admin permission levels (Super Admin, Support Admin, etc.)?
   No.  Anyone with admin has all admin rights.

  2. Dashboard Analytics

  - What specific metrics do you want to see on the admin dashboard? (Total revenue, new signups this
  month, active franchisees, etc.)
  Total users, user growth, total leads (across all users), total bookings (across all users), revenue metrics

  - What time periods should be available? (Last 30 days, quarter, year, custom range?)
  Add a selector to pick time range of dashboard data

  - Do you need charts/graphs, or just numerical displays?

  3. Invite User Feature

  - Who can send invites? (Only admins, or franchisees too?)
  Admins and Users can both send invites.  Users (what you keep calling Franchisees), can send invites with a referral code.  We will hook up referral codes with account credits or other incentives later.

  subscription tier?)
  It should just take them to the account creation page.

  4. Stripe Integration & Payments

  - What subscription tiers/pricing plans do you want to offer?
  All Free for now.  Use a 3-tier model for placeholder.  Free, Plus, Pro.

**Note:** Bugs #1-10 have been archived to [bugs-archive.md](./bugs-archive.md) for better performance.

<details>
<summary><strong>Bug #11:</strong> Bulk table actions limited to Archive only</summary>

### Title: Bulk table actions limited to Archive only
### Status: `RESOLVED` ‚úÖ 2025-06-30
### Priority: Low - workflow improvement

### Issue
- **Problem:** Bulk table actions only show "Archive" option instead of all available Actions Menu actions
- **Impact:** Limited bulk operation capabilities, inefficient workflow
- **Affects:** All portal tables with bulk actions (Leads, Bookings, etc.)

### Expected Behavior
- Bulk actions should include all options available in individual row Actions Menu
- Users should be able to perform any bulk operation they can do individually

### Implementation Summary
Enhanced bulk operations with permanent header dropdown:
1. **Permanent Bulk Actions Dropdown** - Added to page header controls on right side as requested
2. **Complete Status Updates** - All 8 lead statuses (New, Booked Upcoming, Follow-up, etc.)
3. **Archive/Unarchive Actions** - Context-aware based on current view (archived vs active)
4. **Bulk Delete** - With confirmation dialog for safety
5. **Selection Persistence** - Maintains selections during scroll operations
6. **Immediate UI Feedback** - Shows selection count in button, clears immediately on action

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/portal/Leads.tsx` - Added permanent bulk actions dropdown to header
- `src/components/leads/LeadsTable.tsx` - Updated to share selection state with parent

**Ready for Testing:** Permanent bulk actions dropdown positioned in header provides all functionality with better UX than popup bar. Selection state persists during scroll and provides immediate feedback.

<summary><strong>Bug #38:</strong> Admin user impersonation shows incorrect data context</summary>

### Title: Admin user impersonation shows incorrect data context
### Status: `OPEN` üî¥ 2025-07-08
### Priority: High - Admin functionality broken
### Severity: üü† High

### Issue
- **Problem:** When admin users impersonate other franchisees, portal shows admin's data instead of impersonated user's data
- **Impact:** Admin cannot effectively support users or debug their specific issues
- **Affects:** Admin impersonation system, all portal components (locations, leads, bookings, profile)

### Reproduction Steps
1. Login as admin user (justinstephenprice@gmail.com or southdenver@soccerstars.com)
2. Navigate to Admin ‚Üí User Management
3. Click "Impersonate User" on any franchisee
4. Navigate to impersonated user's portal (locations, profile, etc.)
5. **Expected:** See impersonated user's specific data
6. **Actual:** Still shows admin user's data (southdenver@soccerstars.com locations/profile)

### Technical Analysis
- Impersonation session storage works correctly
- ImpersonationBanner shows correct target user
- Exit impersonation navigation works
- **Root Issue:** Some data hooks still bypass impersonation context despite multiple fix attempts

### Files Affected
- `src/hooks/useImpersonation.ts` - Session management
- `src/utils/impersonationHelpers.ts` - Context helpers  
- `src/hooks/useFranchiseeProfile.ts` - User profile data
- `src/pages/portal/Locations.tsx` - Location data
- `src/pages/portal/Profile.tsx` - Profile management
- Portal data hooks that may still use direct auth queries

### Attempted Fixes
1. ‚úÖ Added impersonation session management
2. ‚úÖ Created getEffectiveUserId() helper function
3. ‚úÖ Updated core hooks (useFranchiseeProfile, useFranchiseeData)
4. ‚úÖ Updated portal components (Locations.tsx, Profile.tsx)
5. ‚ùå Data context still not switching correctly

### Next Steps for Resolution
- Deep audit of all data hooks for direct auth.uid() usage
- Investigate query caching issues that might preserve admin context
- Consider alternative impersonation implementation approach
- Test with React Query devtools to verify query key changes

### Business Impact
- Admin cannot effectively support users
- User debugging and issue resolution severely limited
- Admin productivity reduced for customer service tasks

<summary><strong>Bug #12:</strong> URGENT: Booking flow broken due to CardHeader undefined error</summary>

### Title: URGENT: Booking flow broken due to CardHeader undefined error
### Status: `RESOLVED` ‚úÖ 2025-06-28
### Priority: P0 Critical - Revenue blocking
### Severity: üî¥ Critical

### Issue
- **Problem:** JavaScript error "CardHeader is not defined" prevents users from clicking locations to proceed with booking
- **Impact:** COMPLETE BOOKING FLOW BROKEN - Users cannot book classes, resulting in revenue loss
- **Affects:** All public-facing booking pages, specifically find-classes location selection

### Error Details
```
ReferenceError: CardHeader is not defined
    at index-BxKVA-Fw.js:3504:15285
    at Array.map (<anonymous>)
    at Yxe (index-BxKVA-Fw.js:3504:14771)
```

### Root Cause Analysis
- Caused by recent Mantine migration where CardHeader component was not properly imported/converted
- Error occurs during location card rendering in find-classes flow
- Missing import or incorrect component name after shadcn/ui ‚Üí Mantine migration

### Resolution Implemented
Fixed CardHeader import/reference issues in ClassBooking.tsx component migration to Mantine components.

### Priority Justification
- **P0 Critical**: This was a public-facing revenue-blocking bug
- **Immediate Risk**: Loss of all new bookings until fixed
- **Customer Impact**: Users could not complete the core business function

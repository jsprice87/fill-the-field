## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Task 1.0** - Critical data display issues that affect user experience
2. **Move to Task 2.0** - Professional appearance improvements for customer-facing pages
3. **Continue with Task 3.0** - Visual consistency across portal pages
4. **Push changes after each major task** for testing and validation
5. **Complete remaining tasks** based on priority and available time

## Next Steps

Begin with **Task 1.1**: Investigate duplicated class names on classes page - this is a data display issue that looks unprofessional and could confuse users.

2. **Move to Task 2.0** - Professional appearance improvements for customer-facing pages
3. **Continue with Task 3.0** - Visual consistency across portal pages
4. **Push changes after each major task** for testing and validation
5. **Complete remaining tasks** based on priority and available time

## âœ… COMPLETED WORK

### Verified Bug Fixes:
- **#19, #30**: Fixed Parent Guardian asterisk positioning - Added proper `ml-1` spacing for inline asterisks
- **#24**: Visual date selection indicators already properly implemented with CheckCircle icons
- **#25**: Share with Friends message content is clean - only uses `text` parameter as required
- **#26**: Facebook/Instagram icons properly implemented with lucide-react icons and text labels

### Status:
- **4 bugs verified and resolved** (asterisk positioning, date selection, share message, social icons)
- **Critical form usability issues fixed**
- **User experience improvements confirmed**
- **Ready for user testing and validation**

### Implementation Notes:
- Parent Guardian form asterisks now display inline with proper spacing
- Date selection already had visual indicators working correctly
- Share functionality follows clean implementation without extra parameters
- Social media icons combine visual icons with text labels for better UX

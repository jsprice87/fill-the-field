Ready for new scratch notes.


 - User cannot update waiver in /portal/settings the very first time they create their profile.  They have to first hit "Save Waiver" and then the text box becomes editable.
    -- Low priority, corner case

 - Language requirement option in /settings/ needs it's own section with a blue "how it works" section.

 - Booking restritction still need to be updated to include "next available only" as an option.

 - The new lead capture form has duplicate asterisks on each field.  See '/media/screenshots/Screenshot 2025-06-28 at 3.03.23 PM.png'

 - /free-trial/find-classes needs to have Soccer Stars branding and color pallate.  It is using /portal/ styling rather than Soccer Stars styling.  See https://soccerstars.com for example colors and styles.

 - URGENT! Booking flow broken.  Unable to click on a location to move to the booking page:
